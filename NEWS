* version 2.2.4
- Fixed an issue about overwritting user data when a data.table was provided with the tree_data agrument to check_plot_coord() or divide_plot()  
- Added the 'longlat' argument to the divide_plot() function to allow the use of geographic coordinates (instead of projected coordinates)
- Modification of subplot_summary() to enable several metrics to be summarised according to a list of functions
- Fixed an issue in predictHeight() when the function was called with stand-specific HD models and a non-null plot argument
- RSE output for Chave's method in retrieveH() now returns NA's instead of 0.243 (which was the RSE of log(H))
- This version is fully compatible with the shiny application of the package (BIOMASSApp)

* version 2.2.3
- Added 3 dataset to the package (NouraguesTrees, NouraguesCoords and NouraguesPlot201) and removed KarnatakaForest
- Creation of 2 more educational vignettes (Vignette_BIOMASS and Vignette_spatialized_trees_and_forest_stand_metrics)
- Updated pkgdown BIOMASS website

* version 2.2.2
- Add the ref_raster argument to the check_plot_coord() function to display the plot over a reference raster (typically a chm). 
- Add the prop_tree argument to display trees proportionally (in size and alpha transparency) to a tree_data variable

* version 2.2.1 
- Modified check_plot_coord(), the function now : 
  - handles multiple plots using the 'plot_id' and 'tree_plot_id' arguments. The new argument 'ask' prompts user before displaying each plot. 
  - takes as its first argument a data-frame of corner coordinates (in a pipe-use way), and the column names of its relative/projected coordinates for the rest  


* version 2.2
- Modified bilinear interpolation to generalized bilinear interpolation that can deal with rectangular plot and non (0;0) origin corner plot
- Added check_plot_coord function which will replace correctCoordGPS() :
  - calculation of projected coordinates of plot corners depend on trust_GPS_corners argument : if TRUE, a bilinear interpolation is applied (after averaging plot corners and removing outliers) to retrieve tree projected coordinates, if FALSE a procrust analyses is applied as before
  - rangeX and rangeY are no longer needed : they are calculated using relative coordinates dimensions of the plot corners
  - a ggplot is returned as output instead of a plot of the plot
  - calculation of the projected coordinates of the trees is done, using tree_df and tree_coords arguments
- Added divide_plot function which will replace cutPlot()
  - No corner numerotation is needed anymore, neither dimX and dimY (the dimensions of the plot)
  - plot division is made on relative coordinates and then transformed in projected coordinates (if provided) with a bilinear interpolation
  - trees are attributed to each subplot using tree_df and tree_coords agruments
  - Message warning if the grid dimensions don't match the plot dimensions
  - Used of the argument grid_tol to control the plot area which is included in the grid
  - The grid can be plot-centred using centred_grid argument
- Added subplot_summary which will replace summaryByPlot
  - the function can take any tree metric using the value argument
  - any valid function can be applied as a summary
  - a ggplot is returned as output instead of just plot the plot division
- Added "Spatialized trees and forest stands metrics with BIOMASS" vignette which will replace the "Manage trees and plot coordinates with BIOMASS" vignette

* version 2.1.14
- Fix an issue about the inversion of subplot locations in cutPlot
- Change the automatic corner numbering from counter-clockwise to clockise direction in cutPlot
- Fix an issue with summaryByPlot when a plot do not contains any tree
- Replace the procrust analyses used to calculate sub-plot corners with a bilinear interpolation that takes the coordinates of the projected plot corners as references.

* version 2.1.13
- Activate pkgdown

* version 2.1.12
- fix missing export of function predictHeight

* version 2.1.11
- Move from httr to httr2 package for correctTaxo
- Replace sp and raster dependencies by sf and terra

* version 2.1.10
- Add a graceful failure message in case of API or connection failure to match the CRAN policy

* version 2.1.9
- Change of the reference dataset in correctTaxo function to avoid a bug (tropicos was no longer maintained)
- Add a graceful failure message in case of API or connection failure to match the CRAN policy

* version 2.1.7
- Remove the as.vector to match the latest development versions of R

* version 2.1.6
- Fit the CRAN policies regarding the cache management by defaulting location to
R session temp folder (issue #30)
  - Use function createCache to activate a permanent cache
  - clearCache function allows to clear or remove permanent cache folder
- Avoid all tests based on downloading rasters (E and bioclim parameters)

* version 2.1.5
- updated TNRS API request code in correctTaxo (issue #25)

* version 2.1.4
- replaced taxosaurus with TNRS for name resolution in correctTaxo
- spell check documentation (thank you Mauro)
- fix an issue with summaryByPlot when a plot contains a single tree
- added fetching accepted names in correctTaxo
- removed unneeded dependencies on usethis, taxize, covr, rvest, MCMCglmm and lmfor

* version 2.1.3
-

* version 2.1.2
- Modified dataset for compatibility issues with new rgdal package

* version 2.1
- bugs correction
- add a vignette for the managment of the plot
- add few tricks for the summaryByPlot
- add of a function to convert tree relative to absolute coordinates

* version 2.0
- code optimization of most functions
- new functions: computeFeldRegion, attributeTree, correctCoordGPS, cutPlot, latlong2UTM, numberCorner, summaryByPlot, updateCache
- Re-writing of the dataset Karnataka forest, there were missing stems in the previous version of this database

* version 1.2
- Duplicated genera from the plantList have been fixed in the "genusFamily" dataset (e.g. The family Jungermanniaceae was given for the genus Massularia, now the dataset gives the Rubiaceae family)

* version 1.1
- The NouraguesHD dataset has now taxonomic information
- The warning message from the computeAGB function has been removed
- The correctTaxo function have been slightly modified to handle species names not recognized by TNRS
- The getWoodDensity function has been slightly modified to deal with NA values in addWoodDensityData, which is now a data.frame of three colums and not four (the family column is now internaly built).
- The computeAGB and AGBmonteCarlo functions have an additional argument: Dlim (see help).
- The AGBmonteCarlo function has now an option to propagate error up to the carbon estimate (see the argument Carbon).

* version 1.0
Initial version of BIOMASS
