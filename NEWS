- spell check documentation (thank you Mauro)
- fix an issue with summaryByPlot when a plot contains a single tree
- added fetching accepted names in correctTaxo
- removed unneeded dependencies on usethis, taxize, covr, rvest, MCMCglmm and lmfor

* version 2.1.3
- 

* version 2.1.2
- Modified dataset for compatibility issues with new rgdal package

* version 2.1
- bugs correction
- add a vignette for the managment of the plot
- add few tricks for the summaryByPlot
- add of a function to convert tree relative to absolute coordinates

* version 2.0
- code optimization of most functions
- new functions: computeFeldRegion, attributeTree, correctCoordGPS, cutPlot, latlong2UTM, numberCorner, summaryByPlot, updateCache
- Re-writing of the dataset Karnataka forest, there were missing stems in the previous version of this database

* version 1.2
- Duplicated genera from the plantList have been fixed in the "genusFamily" dataset (e.g. The family Jungermanniaceae was given for the genus Massularia, now the dataset gives the Rubiaceae family)

* version 1.1
- The NouraguesHD dataset has now taxonomic information
- The warning message from the computeAGB function has been removed
- The correctTaxo function have been slightly modified to handle species names not recognized by TNRS
- The getWoodDensity function has been slightly modified to deal with NA values in addWoodDensityData, which is now a data.frame of three colums and not four (the family column is now internaly built).
- The computeAGB and AGBmonteCarlo functions have an additional argument: Dlim (see help).
- The AGBmonteCarlo function has now an option to propagate error up to the carbon estimate (see the argument Carbon).

* version 1.0
