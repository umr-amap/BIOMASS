## The package

R package for estimating aboveground biomass and its uncertainty in
tropical forests.

Contains functions to estimate aboveground biomass/carbon and its
uncertainty in tropical forests. These functions allow to:

1.  retrieve and correct the taxonomy;
2.  estimate the wood density and its uncertainty;
3.  construct height-diameter models;
4.  manage tree and plot coordinates;
5.  estimate the aboveground biomass/carbon at the stand level with
    associated uncertainty;
